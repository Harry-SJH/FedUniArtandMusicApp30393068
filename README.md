The application should include the following features:
• The Main Activity should function as a menu that allows the user the open additional screen(s)
that include the other functions described below. This menu screen should be locked to
portrait orientation.
• One main feature of the app involves a digital sketch book, in which the user can draw images
on screen using the touch interface of the device. This screen should be locked to portrait, and
include a menu with various options for the user to select to interact with the sketch.

Another key feature of the app involves a digital piano, in which the user can play notes on a
piano by touching the virtual piano keys displayed in the app (using the piano image you have
been provided). You have been provided with a piano note sample of the middle C (also called
C4). This should be used to play the appropriate note whenever a key is pressed. Note that
there is a simple mathematical relationship between the notes in a piano’s musical scale, and
you can find the list of note frequencies.
